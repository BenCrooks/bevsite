            introduction to creative research
          </div>
          <br />
          <br />
          Embodied-entanglements/entangled-embodiments is an experimental
          creative process that explores female bodies at work. The creative act
          of weaving is core to my creative research into embodiment.
          <br />
          <br />
          The process manifests in tactile material objects that I call
          embodied-entanglements. These are amorphous woven, mixed-media,
          stitched, printed, painted, embellished, beaded, dimensional,
          assemblaged constellations. These hybrid material objects represent a
          moment of connection, enmeshing/knotting together materials,
          creative-making processes and my embodied gestures of work.
          <br /> <br />
          Embodiment is viewed here as both a concept and a product of creative
          work. Weaving takes shape through a sequence of bodily gestures and
          performances: the process of weaving becomes a tool to explore how
          personal experience is communicated through bodily gesture. I approach
          weaving as a particularly female activity, looking specifically at
          women’s bodies and women’s work. The research considers the tension
          between female-embodied experience and the norms of femininity, which
          embed restriction and impose constraint into female bodies. It is
          these restricted gestures that become embodied in the weaves through
          the women who make them. Further facets of the concept of embodiment
          are explored through the materials and labour that function as inputs
          to the weaving process. The research also recognises the body of the
          viewer as intimately implicated in navigating the environment produced
          by the work. <br />
          <br />
          To facilitate my research process, I set up my artist studio at the
          Bag Factory as a collaborative weaving laboratory, with collaborators
          working with me at weaving, beading and sewing, activities that are
          socially-coded: historically often assigned to Western females.
          <br />
          <br /> At its core, the research originates in the studio practice,
          with creative processes driving the research as thinking-tools.
          Research-led practice is fundamental to exploring the constraints that
          have been socialised into my female body and to unravel these within
          my studio practice to amplify the creative freedom I express in my
          work. By allowing the intuition/the body to lead, the process is
          organic, fluid, reflexive, spontaneous, progressive and unstructured.
          This multi-modal process is aimed at activating different
          thought-processes and dissolving traditional boundaries of genre -
          learning happens in the cross pollination.

            coded materials
          </div>
          <br /> <br />
          My practice is deeply invested in materials and the traces they leave.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since people form an attachment to the stuff around us, such materials
          carve out a space of personal significance. Some of my materials hold
          deep family resonance like my grandmother hoarding ribbon. Fabrics
          taken out my home bring the dismissed domestic space to the
          foreground. In these ways, materials express a strong social coding.
          <br />
          <br />
          Individual materials get lost within the entanglement, emerging again
          as part of an entangled texture.

          <br />
          Weaving is slow, it consumes time, work, labour, materials.
          <br />
          <br />
          It requires total concentration.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mesmerizing rhythm and regularity.
          <br />
          <br />
          It embeds mundane repetition; develops a pattern of activity. Pattern,
          with its infinite reproductions, communicates messages with an
          intensity that is unspeakable.
          <br />
          <br />
          Slowly,
          <br />
          from the jumble of materials
          <br />
          the weave materializes

          sedimented surfaces hold the encounter with the artists’ hands
          <br />
          <br />
          Clumps of thickly encrusted beads slathered in oil paint. Glue
          dripping, gloopy over gold leaf shapes. Costume jewellery, woven
          together, beads strung taut. Heavily-worked textured surfaces are
          alive with expressive painterly marks.

          <br />
          <br />
          By recognising the body as a deposit site, embodied making becomes a
          way to unravel social conscriptions implanted invisibly into women’s
          bodies. This disciplining and coding happens in multiple ways. My
          artist’s body is a site of projection from which to try understand
          these programmed responses.

          <br />
          The creative act of weaving is core to my creative research into
          embodiment. Through this embodied contact, weaving has the capacity to
          enact the experience of femininity: it embodies an expansion and
          contraction, breaking out, freeing the control imposed by two
          dimensions, and then conforming to the grid again.

            texture of gendered life; my subjective feminine experience

          <br />
          <br />
          The creative process gives material expression to the tensions and
          contradictions of gendered expectations around women, like the pulls
          and demands of motherhood, relationship and family. The act of
          entangling is a surprisingly apt way of describing my life.

          Woven threads, some forthright, consistent, behaving according to
          coded rules. Diverse. Divergent. Multiple. Others unruly. Unravelling.
          Yet other entangled. Knotted. Complex. Opaque.
