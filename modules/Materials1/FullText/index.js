          Embodied-entanglements/ entangled-embodiments is an experimental
          creative process that explores how making entangled objects through a
          sustained making practice can expose and make meaning of embodied
          experiences that get written into female bodies at work. I consider
          the specific gendered experiences of labour, its invisibility and the
          resulting tensions created through socially-encoded expectations on
          women to work excessively and overload with responsibility.
          <br />
          <br />
          The creative act of weaving is core to my creative research into
          embodiment.
          <br /> <br />
          Embodiment as a broad concept is explored in this process on multiple
          levels. The process considers how experiences are communicated through
          the human body. It also interrogates what it means to embody in
          relation to both materials and personal experience by foregrounding my
          artist body as a sedimentary site of knowledge accumulated through the
          micro-events of life. It recognises the body of the viewer as
          intimately implicated in interpreting the visual and sensory stimuli.
          This submission narrows the focus to explore how encounters with
          material and labour within the process of weaving enable one to
          consider the concept of embodiment from multiple facets. <br />
          <br />
          To facilitate my research process, I set up my artist studio at the
          Bag Factory as a collaborative weaving laboratory, with collaborators
          working with me at weaving, beading and sewing, activities that are
          socially-coded: historically often assigned to Western females.
          <br />
          <br /> This transitional and transactional holding space is the site
          of a wide variety of interactions which feed my process of creative
          research. The research narrows in on six of these encounters:
          materials, labour, embodiment, process, tensions of being a woman and
          making meaning through multimodality. Each encounter, which guides and
          sustains the studio making, stands as individually significant, but
          also contributes in combination with others. The process moves fluidly
          and interchangeably between the encounters – at times, concentrating
          on a particular one; at others, considering them as intermeshed
          entanglings.
          <br />
          <br />
          At its core, the research originates in the studio practice, with
          creative processes driving the research as tools for thinking and
          making meaning. My studio practice employs a multi-modal and reflexive
          process aimed at activating different thought-processes and dissolving
          traditional boundaries of genre . By allowing the intuition/the body
          to lead, the process is organic, fluid, reflexive, spontaneous,
          progressive, unstructured and messy. Multimodal engagement becomes a
          way to think through issues and to track the shifts in meaning that
          occur through the process. Learning happens in the cross pollination.
          <br /> <br />
          The process manifests in tactile material objects that I call
          embodied-entanglements . These are amorphous woven, mixed-media,
          stitched, printed, painted, embellished, beaded, dimensional,
          assemblaged constellations. These hybrid material objects represent a
          moment of connection, enmeshing/ knotting together materials, creative
          - making processes and my embodied gestures of work.

            material
          </div>
          <br /> <br />
          My practice is deeply invested in materials and the sensory and
          associative traces they leave. A disarray of materials infuse the
          creative process. Through the clutter, we recognise a deliberate
          conceptual choice.
          <br />
          <br />
          Since people form an attachment to the stuff that surrounds us, such
          materials develop value through how they carve out a space of personal
          significance. Some of my materials hold deep family resonance for
          me... fragments of memories... like my grandmother hoarding ribbon,
          sparingly reused to wrap special gifts (in carefully - unwrapped
          carefully - refolded carefully - stored carefully - preserved wrapping
          paper). Some fabrics taken out my home bring the dismissed domestic
          space to the foreground, evoking the drudgery and gendered slant of
          domestic work. Strongly evoked alongside this are the racialised tones
          of the history of domestic labour in South Africa. In these ways,
          materials express a strong social coding.
          <br />
          <br />
          While giving attention to individual materials, the process
          simultaneously destabilises any view of materials as fixed or solid:
          individual materials get lost within the social entanglement, emerging
          again as a diluted or mingled part of a heavy texture.

          <br />
          Weaving is slow, it consumes time, work, labour, materials.
          <br />
          It requires total concentration.
          <br />
          Patience.
          <br />
          The process is methodical.
          <br />
          Meticulous.
          <br />
          It embeds repetitive, mundane re-enactment.
          <br />
          Sturdy arm muscles. Back held up straight.
          <br />
          <br />
          Mesmerizing rhythm and regularity.
          <br />
          <br />
          An enactment of work that is obsessive, caring, hard physical labour.
          <br />
          <br />
          The labour of weaving develops a pattern of activity. Pattern, with
          its infinite reproductions, commun icates messages with an intensity
          that is unspeakable

          Clumps of thickly encrusted beads slathered in oil paint. Glue
          dripping, gloopy over gold leaf shapes. Costume jewellery, woven and
          over woven together, beads strung taut, weight bearing down.
          Heavily-worked textured surfaces are alive with expressive pain terly
          marks; hints of colours, structure lines and pattern dancing in and
          out of vision, breaking through sporadically to reveal an underlying
          buildup of layers.

          The tactile physical intricacy of the woven surfaces holds a strong
          sense of human presence: the encounter with the artists’ hands.
          Suggestions of contact. Shadows of interaction.
          <br />
          <br />
          the body as a site of coded knowledge
          <br />
          <br />
          By recognising the body as a deposit site, embodied making becomes a
          way to unravel social conscriptions implanted invisibly into women’s
          bodies. This disciplining and coding happens in multiple ways. My
          artist’s body is thus a site of projection from which to try
          understand these programmed or disciplined responses.
          <br />
          <br />
          weaving is bodily
          <br />
          <br />
          The creative act of weaving is core to my creative research into
          embodiment. Through this embodied contact, weaving has the capacity to
          enact the experience of femininity: it embodies an expansion and
          contraction, breaking out, freeing the control imposed by two
          dimensions, and then conforming to the grid once again.
          <br />
          <br />
          texture of gendered life; my subjective feminine experience
          <br />
          <br />
          The creative process gives material expression to the tensions and
          contradictions of gendered expectations around women, like the pulls
          and demands of motherhood, relationship and family. The act of
          entangling is a surprisingly apt way of describing my life.
          <br />
          <br />
          Woven threads, some forthright, consistent, behaving according to
          coded rules. Diverse. Divergent. Multiple. Others unruly. Unravelling.
          Yet other entangled. Knotted. Complex. Opaque.
