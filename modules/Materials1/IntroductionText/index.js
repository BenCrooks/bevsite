          Embodied-entanglements/ entangled-embodiments is an experimental
          creative process that explores how making entangled objects through a
          sustained making practice can expose and make meaning of embodied
          experiences that get written into female bodies at work. I consider
          the specific gendered experiences of labour, its invisibility and the
          resulting tensions created through socially-encoded expectations on
          women to assume excess responsibility within the domestic sphere.{" "}
          <br />
          <br />
          The creative act of weaving is core to my creative research into
          embodiment.
          <br /> <br />
          At its core, the research originates in my studio practice, with
          creative processes driving the research as tools for thinking and
          making meaning. My studio practice employs a fluid multi-modal “messy”
          and reflexive process aimed at activating different thought -
          processes and dissolving traditional boundaries of genre. By allowing
          the intuition/the body to lead, the process is organic, fluid,
          reflexive, spontaneous, progressive, unstructured and messy. I employ
          narrative enquiry and auto-ethnography to interrogate my subjective
          feminine experience to ask questions about my ‘disciplined’ body.
          Multimodal engagement becomes a way to think through issues and to
          track the shifts in meaning that occur through the process. Learning
          happens in the cross pollination.
          <br /> <br />
          To facilitate my research process, I set up my artist studio at the
          Bag Factory as a collaborative weaving laboratory, with collaborators
          M. and P. working with me at weaving, beading and sewing, activities
          that are socially-coded: historically assigned to Western females.
          This transitional and transactional holding space is the site of a
          wide variety of interactions which feed my process of creative
          research.
          <br /> <br />
          This research hones in on six of these encounters: materials, labour,
          embodiment, process, tensions associated with being a woman and making
          meaning through multimodality. Each encounter, which guides and
          sustains the studio making, stands as individually significant, but
          also contributes in combination with others. The process moves fluidly
          and interchangeably between the encounters – at times, concentrating
          on a particular one; at others, considering them as intermeshed
          entanglings.
          <br /> <br />
          The process manifests in tactile material objects that I call
          embodied-entanglements . These are amorphous woven, mixed-media,
          stitched, printed, painted, embellished, beaded, dimensional,
          assemblaged constellations. These hybrid material objects represent a
          moment of connection, enmeshing/ knotting together materials,
          creative-making processes and my embodied gestures of work, as well as
          those of my hired studio assistants M. and P .
          <br /> <br />
          Embodiment as a broad concept is central to this process on multiple
          levels. It considers how experiences are communicated through the
          human body. It also interrogates what it means to embody in relation
          to both materials and personal experience by foregrounding my artist
          body as a sedimentary site of knowledge accumulated through the
          micro-events of life. It recognises the body of the viewer as
          intimately implicated in interpreting the visual and sensory stimuli.
          This submission narrows the focus to explore how encounters with
          material and labour within the process of weaving enable one to
          consider the concept of embodiment from multiple facets .
